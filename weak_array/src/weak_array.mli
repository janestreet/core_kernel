(** Module for dealing with weak pointers, i.e., pointers that don't prevent garbage
    collection of what they point to.

    This module is like the OCaml standard library module of the same name, except that it
    requires that the values in the weak set are heap blocks. *)

val create : len:int -> _ t
val length : _ t -> int
val set : 'a t -> int -> 'a Heap_block.t option -> unit

(** [set_exn] raises an exception if given [Some x] with [x] not being a heap block. This
    is in addition to raising exceptions on bounds violation as [set] does. *)
val set_exn : 'a t -> int -> 'a option -> unit

val get : 'a t -> int -> 'a Heap_block.t option
val is_some : _ t -> int -> bool
val is_none : _ t -> int -> bool
val iter : 'a t -> f:('a -> unit) -> unit
val iteri : 'a t -> f:(int -> 'a -> unit) -> unit

(** [blit] is generally preferred over [get] followed by [set] because, unlike [get], it
    doesn't have to make the value strongly-referenced. Making a value
    strongly-referenced, even temporarily, may result in delaying its garbage collection
    by a whole GC cycle. *)
