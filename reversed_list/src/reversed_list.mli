    [of_sexp] and other derivations are not supported because [Reversed_list] is meant to
    be a more ephemeral type and [sexp_of] is only provided for printing convenience,
    e.g., for expect tests. Callers that are motivated to add derivations because they
    want to use [Reversed_list] as part of a type may be better off defining a custom type
    with a more meaningful name that conveys what the ordering represents instead of a
    generic "reversed list." *)
