(** ['a t] is a type that uses [Core.am_running_test] to determine if it should use the
    ['a] sexp serializer, or serialize the type as '<hidden_in_test>'. It can be thought
    of as a form of [@sexp.opaque] that is conditional upon if tests are running. *)
type 'a t = 'a [@@deriving bin_io, compare ~localize, equal ~localize, sexp_of]

(** This type also derives [sexp]. This will not allow you to roundtrip values you create
    in tests and should be used carefully. *)
