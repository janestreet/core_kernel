(** Support for 256-color handling on terminals/consoles. Note that the functions
    [of_rgb6_exn] and [of_rgb6] return values within the 6x6x6 color-cube space, even
    though equivalent duplicates exist in the first 16 and last 24 colors (a
    "best-fit-equivalent" function could be added some day, if there ever becomes a
    requirement for it -- see note 2 below).

    NOTE 1: the color-cube is not linear in terms of RGB levels, but is "shifted" towards
    brighter values (as opposed to a logarithmic or other mapping). Visually, the "rgb6"
    values 0 to 5 (used in [of_rgb6_exn] and encoded in the 256-color palette values) map
    into RGB levels as follows:

    {v
    Cube-val:  0           1    2    3    4    5
       v       +-----------+----+----+----+----+
      RGB:     0           95   135  175  215  255
    v}

    The floating-point values used in [of_rgb] are {e not} weighted in the same way, but
    are rounded to the nearest cube-value -- a value of 0.5 (50% or 127.5/255) would
    result in a color-cube value of 2, for example. Any level less than 0.187 (approx.)
    maps to 0 (black) and greater than 0.921 to 5 (white).

    NOTE 2: is is {e not} recommended to use the 256-color palette for representing the 16
    (8 * 2) 'primary' colors. The standard [`Black], [`Blue], etc. attributes are
    recommended for these. *)

val to_int : t -> int
val of_int_exn : int -> t

(** Takes an RGB triple with values in the range [0,5] (inclusive) and returns the
    appropriate 256-color palette value. Will throw an exception if any of the inputs are
    out-of-range. Note that the input values are weighted as described above. *)
val of_rgb6_exn : int * int * int -> t

(** Takes an RGB triple with float values in the closed (inclusive) interval [0,1] and
    returns the nearest (rounded) 256-color palette value. Out-of-bound values are clamped
    to the range. The inputs are {e not} weighted, unlike [of_rgb6_exn] as described
    above. *)
val of_rgb : float * float * float -> t

(** Takes an RGB triple with integer values in the closed (inclusive) range [0,255] and
    returns the nearest (rounded) 256-color palette color-cube value. Out-of-bound values
    are clamped to the range. The inputs are {e not} weighted, unlike [of_rgb6_exn] as
    described above. *)
val of_rgb_8bit : int * int * int -> t

(** Takes an RGB triple with integer values in the closed (inclusive) range [0,1000] and
    returns the nearest (rounded) 256-color palette color-cube value. Out-of-bound values
    are clamped to the range. The inputs are {e not} weighted, unlike [of_rgb6_exn] as
    described above. *)
val of_rgb_int1k : int * int * int -> t

(** Takes a grayscale level from [0-23] (inclusive, not-black-to-not-white) and returns
    the appropriate 256-color palette value. Will throw an exception if the input value is
    out-of-range. *)
val of_gray24_exn : int -> t

(** Takes a color palette value and returns, for color-cube and grayscale palette values,
    an approximated [`RGB] triple with each component in the range [0,1]; for the first 16
    values, [`Primary] followed by the specific palette index is returned, as these are
    not consistently defined. *)
val to_rgb : t -> [> `Primary of int | `RGB of float * float * float ]

(** Takes a color palette value and returns a hex-encoded RGB 24-bit triplet, with a
    leading '#'. I.e. "#000000" through "#ffffff". The values returned for the first 16
    (primary) colors follow the Windows Console scheme, as documented here:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code . *)
val to_rgb_hex24 : t -> string

(** Takes a color palette value and returns an approximate luminance value in the closed
    interval [0,1]. *)
val to_luma : t -> float

(** Takes a color palette value and returns a triple of RGB integers in the closed
    interval [0,255]. *)
val to_rgb_8bit : t -> int * int * int

(** Takes a color palette value and returns a triple of RGB integers in the closed
    interval [0,1000]. *)
val to_rgb_int1k : t -> int * int * int

(** Takes a color palette value and returns a triple of RGB integers in the closed
    interval [0,5]. For color-cube palette values, this simply un-does [of_rgb6_exn]. For
    others, it will return the closest matching value in the color-cube. *)
