(** A manual memory manager for a set of mutable tuples.

    A pool stores a bounded-size set of tuples, where client code is responsible for
    explicitly controlling when the pool allocates and frees tuples.  One [create]s a pool
    of a certain capacity, which returns an empty pool that can hold that many tuples.
    One then uses [new] to allocate a tuple, which returns a [Pointer.t] to the tuple.
    One then uses [get] and [set] along with the pointer to get and set slots of the
    tuple.  Finally, one [free]'s a pointer to the pool's memory for a tuple, making the
    memory available for subsequent reuse.

    The point of [Pool] is to allocate a single long-lived block of memory (the pool) that
    lives in the OCaml major heap, and then to reuse the block, rather than continually
    allocating blocks on the minor heap.

    In typical usage, one wraps up a pool with an abstract interface, giving nice names to
    the tuple slots, and only exposing mutation where desired.

    All the usual problems with manual memory allocation are present with pools:

    - one can mistakenly use a pointer after it is freed
    - one can mistakenly free a pointer multiple times
    - one can forget to free a pointer

    There is a debugging functor, [Pool.Error_check], that is useful for building pools
    to help debug incorrect pointer usage.

      it is difficult to construct a dummy value.
