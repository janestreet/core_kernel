(** doubly-linked lists

    Compared to other doubly-linked lists, in this one:

    1. Calls to modification functions (insert*, move*, ...) detect if the list is being
    iterated over (iter, fold, ...), and if so raise an exception.  For example, a use
    like the following would raise.

    {[
      iter t ~f:(fun _ -> ... remove t e ...)
    ]}

    2. There is a designated "front" and "back" of each list, rather than viewing each
    element as an equal in a ring.

    3. Elements know which list they're in.  Each operation that takes an [Elt.t] also
    takes a [t], first checks that the [Elt] belongs to the [t], and if not, raises.

    4. Related to (3), lists cannot be split, though a sort of splicing is available as
    [transfer].  In other words, no operation will cause one list to become two.  This
    makes this module unsuitable for maintaining the faces of a planar graph under edge
    insertion and deletion, for example.

    5. Another property permitted by (3) and (4) is that [length] is O(1).

    same order (i.e. the first element of [l] is the first element of [t]).  It is always
    the case that [l = to_list (of_list l)]. *)

(** [fold_elt t ~init ~f] is the same as fold, except [f] is called with the ['a Elt.t]'s
    from the list instead of the contained ['a] values.

    Note that like other iteration functions, it is an error to mutate [t] inside the
    fold. If you'd like to call [remove] on any of the ['a Elt.t]'s, accumulate them here
    and do so after [fold_elt] returns. *)

(** [find_elt t ~f] finds the first element in [t] that satisfies [f], by testing each of
    element of [t] in turn until [f] succeeds. *)
val find_elt : 'a t -> f:('a -> bool) -> 'a Elt.t option

(** [clear t] removes all elements from the list in constant time. *)
val clear : 'a t -> unit

val copy : 'a t -> 'a t

(** [transfer ~src ~dst] has the same behavior as
    [iter src ~f:(insert_last dst); clear src]
    except that it runs in constant time.

    If [s = to_list src] and [d = to_list dst], then after [transfer ~src ~dst]:
      [to_list src = []]
      [to_list dst = d @ s] *)
val transfer : src:'a t -> dst:'a t -> unit

(** [filter_inplace t ~f] removes all elements of [t] that don't satisfy [f]. *)
val filter_inplace : 'a t -> f:('a -> bool) -> unit

(** [unchecked_iter t ~f] behaves like [iter t ~f] except that [f] is allowed to modify
    [t].  Adding or removing elements before the element currently being visited has no
    effect on the traversal.  Elements added after the element currently being visited
    will be traversed.  Elements deleted after the element currently being visited will
    not be traversed.  Deleting the element currently visited is an error that is not
    detected (presumably leading to an infinite loop) . *)
