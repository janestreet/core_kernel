(** OCaml's native integer type.

    The number of bits in an integer is platform dependent, being 31-bits on a 32-bit
    platform, and 63-bits on a 64-bit platform.  [int] is a signed integer type.  [int]s
    are also subject to overflow, meaning that [Int.max_value + 1 = Int.min_value].

    [int]s always fit in a machine word.
