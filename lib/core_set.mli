(** This module defines the [Set] module for [Core.Std].  We use "core_set" as the file
    name rather than "set" to avoid conflicts with OCaml's standard set module.

    This module uses the same organizational approach as [Core_map].  See the
    documentation in core_map.mli for a description of the approach.

    Functions that construct a set take as an argument the comparator for the element
    type.
