    shares the same memory region, i.e. modifying it will modify the
    original bigstring.  Holding on to the sub-bigstring will also keep

(** {6 Memory mapping} *)

val map_file : shared : bool -> Unix.file_descr -> int -> t
(** [map_file shared fd n] memory-maps [n] characters of the data associated with
    descriptor [fd] to a bigstring.  Iff [shared] is [true], all changes to the bigstring
    will be reflected in the file.

    Users must keep in mind that operations on the resulting bigstring may result in disk
    operations which block the runtime.  This is true for pure OCaml operations (such as
    t.{1} <- 1), and for calls to [blit].  While some I/O operations may release the OCaml
    lock, users should not expect this to be done for all operations on a bigstring
    returned from [map_file].  *)

(** {6 Search} *)

(** [find ?pos ?len char t] returns [Some i] for the smallest [i >= pos] such that
    [t.{i} = char], or [None] if there is no such [i].

    @param pos default = 0
    @param len default = [length bstr - pos] *)
val find

(** {6 Destruction} *)

(** [unsafe_destroy bstr] destroys the bigstring by deallocating its associated data or,
    if memory-mapped, unmapping the corresponding file, and setting all dimensions to
    zero.  This effectively frees the associated memory or address-space resources
    instantaneously.  This feature helps working around a bug in the current OCaml
    runtime, which does not correctly estimate how aggressively to reclaim such resources.

    This operation is safe unless you have passed the bigstring to another thread that is
    performing operations on it at the same time.  Access to the bigstring after this
    operation will yield array bounds exceptions.

    @raise Failure if the bigstring has already been deallocated (or deemed "external",
    which is treated equivalently), or if it has proxies, i.e. other bigstrings referring
    to the same data. *)
external unsafe_destroy : t -> unit = "bigstring_destroy_stub"

(* Accessors for parsing binary values, analogous to binary_packing.  These are in
   Bigstring rather than a separate module because:

   1) Existing binary_packing requires copies and does not work with bigstrings
   2) The accessors rely on the implementation of bigstring, and hence should
   changeshould the implementation of bigstring move away from Bigarray.
   3) Bigstring already has some external C functions, so it didn't require many
   changes to the OMakefile ^_^.

   In a departure from Binary_packing, the naming conventions are chosen to be close to
   C99 stdint types, as it's a more standard description and it is somewhat useful in
   making compact macros for the implementations.  The accessor names contain endian-ness
   to allow for branch-free implementations

   <accessor>  ::= <unsafe><operation><type><endian><int>
   <unsafe>    ::= unsafe_ | ''
   <operation> ::= get_ | set_
   <type>      ::= int16 | uint16 | int32 | int64
   <endian>    ::= _le | _be | ''
   <int>       ::= _int | ''

   The "unsafe_" prefix indicates that these functions do no bounds checking.  Performance
   testing demonstrated that the bounds check was 2-3 times slower due to the fact that
   Bigstring.length is a C call, and not even a noalloc one.  In practice, message parsers
   can check the size of an outer message once, and use the unsafe accessors for
   individual fields, so many bounds checks can end up being redundant as well. The
   situation could be improved by having bigarray cache the length/dimensions. *)

   precision (i.e. Less than Max_Long), then we can avoid allocation and use an
   immediate.  If the user is wrong, an exception will be thrown (for get). *)
