  (** [create ?min_size ~cmp] returns a new min-heap that can store [min_size] elements
      without reallocations, using ordering function [cmp].

      The top of the heap is the smallest element as determined by the provided comparison
      function.  In particular, if [cmp x y < 0] then [x] will be "on top of" [y] in the
      heap.

      Memory use is surprising in two ways:

      1. The underlying pool never shrinks, so current memory use will at least be
      proportional to the largest number of elements that the heap has ever held.

      2. Not all the memory is freed upon [remove], but rather after some number of
      subsequent [pop] operations. Alternating [add] and [remove] operations can therefore
      use unbounded memory.
