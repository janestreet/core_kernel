(** A buffer for incremental decoding of an input stream.

    An [Unpack_buffer.t] is a buffer to which one can [feed] strings, and then [unpack]
    from the buffer to produce a queue of values. *)

  (** If [unpack_one : ('a, 'state) unpack], then [unpack_one ~state ~buf ~pos ~len] must
      unpack at most one value of type ['a] from [buf] starting at [pos], and not using
      more than [len] characters. [unpack_one] must return one the following:

      - [`Ok (value, n)] -- unpacking succeeded and consumed [n] bytes, where
        [0 <= n <= len]. It is possible to have [n = 0], e.g. for sexp unpacking, which
        can only tell it has reached the end of an atom when it encounters the following
        punctuation character, which if it is left paren, is the start of the following
        sexp.

      - [`Not_enough_data (state, n)] -- unpacking encountered a valid proper prefix of a
        packed value, and consumed [n] bytes, where [0 <= n <= len]. [state] can be
        supplied to a future call to [unpack_one] to continue unpacking.

      - [`Invalid_data] -- unpacking encountered an invalidly packed value.

      A naive [unpack_one] that only succeeds on a fully packed value could lead to
      quadratic behavior if a packed value's bytes are input using a linear number of
      calls to [feed]. *)
