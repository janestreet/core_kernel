(** A hashtable that keeps a weak pointer to each key's data and uses a finalizer to
    detect when the data is no longer referenced (by any non-weak pointers).

    Once a key's data is finalized, the table will effectively behave as if the key is not
    in the table, e.g., [find] will return [None]. However, one must call
    [reclaim_space_for_keys_with_unused_data] to actually reclaim the space used by the
    table for such keys.

    Unlike (OCaml's) [Weak.Make], which also describes itself as a "weak hashtable,"
    [Weak_hashtbl] gives a dictionary-style structure. In fact, OCaml's [Weak.Make] may
    better be described as a weak set.

    There's a tricky type of bug one can write with this module, e.g.:

    {[
      type t =
        { foo : string
        ; bar : float Incr.t
        }

      let tbl = Weak_hashtbl.create ()
      let x1 =
        let t = Weak_hashtbl.find_or_add tbl key ~default:(fun () ->
          (... some function that computes a t...))
        in
        t.bar
    ]}

    At this point, the data associated with [key] is unreachable (since all we did with it
    was project out field [bar]), so it may disappear from the table at any time. *)
