(** A thread-safe non-blocking queue of unbounded size.

    doesn't want to block, e.g., a finalizer or an async job. *)

(** [dequeue t] returns [Dequeue_result.Empty] if [length t = 0], and
    [Dequeue_result.Not_empty] otherwise. To dequeue a single result, match on this
    result. The return value is locally allocated, so this can be used safely in
    zero_alloc code.

    To dequeue until empty, use [dequeue_until_empty] below.

    Note that testing the length of the queue immediately before calling [dequeue] does
    not guarantee it will return [Not_empty]. This is because the OCaml compiler is
    allowed to insert a polling point (also called a "safe point") at the beginning of
    [dequeue], which may give other threads an opportunity to run. You must always handle
    the possibility of [Not_empty] when calling this function. *)
val dequeue : 'a t -> 'a Dequeue_result.t

(** [dequeue_until_empty ~f t] iteratively dequeues elements of [t] and applies [f] to
    them until the queue is empty.

    Recall that if you want [dequeue_until_empty]'s arguments to be locally allocated, it
    can not be a tailcall. To achieve this for a call to [dequeue_until_empty] in tail
    position, mark the call with [@nontail]. *)
val dequeue_until_empty : f:('a -> unit) -> 'a t -> unit

(** The queue maintains an internal pool of unused elements, which are used by [enqueue]
    and returned to the pool by [dequeue_exn]. [enqueue] creates a new element if the pool
    is empty. Nothing shrinks the pool automatically. One can call [clear_internal_pool]
    to clear the pool, so that all unused elements will be reclaimed by the garbage
    collector. *)
