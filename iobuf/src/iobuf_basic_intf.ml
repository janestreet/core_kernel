    (** [transfer ~src ~dst] makes the window of [dst] into a copy of the window of [src].

    val transfer : src:([> read ], _) t -> dst:([> write ], seek) t -> unit

    (** [set_bounds_and_buffer ~src ~dst] copies bounds metadata (i.e., limits and window)
        and shallowly copies the buffer (data pointer) from [src] to [dst]. It does not
        access data, but does allow access through [dst]. This makes [dst] an alias of
        [src].

        Because [set_bounds_and_buffer] creates an alias, we disallow immutable [src] and
        [dst] using [[> write]]. Otherwise, one of [src] or [dst] could be
        [read_write :> read] and the other [immutable :> read], which would allow you to
        write the [immutable] alias's data through the [read_write] alias.

        [set_bounds_and_buffer] is typically used with a frame iobuf that need only be
        allocated once. This frame can be updated repeatedly and handed to users, without
        further allocation. Allocation-sensitive applications need this. *)

        [set_bounds_and_buffer ~src ~dst] is not the same as
        [set_bounds_and_buffer_sub ~dst ~src ~len:(Iobuf.length src)] because the limits
        are narrowed in the latter case.

        [~len] and [~pos] are mandatory for performance reasons, in concert with
        [@@inline]. If they were optional, allocation would be necessary when passing a
        non-default, non-constant value, which is an important use case. *)
    val set_bounds_and_buffer_sub
      :  pos:int

    (** {2 Generalization}

        One may wonder why you'd want to call [no_seek], given that a cast is already
        possible, e.g., [t : (_, seek) t :> (_, no_seek) t]. It turns out that if you want
        to define some [f : (_, _) t -> unit] of your own that can be conveniently applied
        to [seek] iobufs without the user having to cast [seek] up, you need this
        [no_seek] function.

        [read_only] is more of a historical convenience now that [read_write] is a
        polymorphic variant, as one can now explicitly specify the general type for an
        argument with something like [t : (_ perms, _) t :> (read, _) t]. *)

    val read_only : ([> read ], 's) t -> (read, 's) t
    val read_only__local : ([> read ], 's) t -> (read, 's) t
    val no_seek : ('r, _) t -> ('r, no_seek) t
    val no_seek__local : ('r, _) t -> ('r, no_seek) t

    (** {2 Accessors} *)

    (** [capacity t] returns the size of [t]'s limits subrange. The capacity of an iobuf
        can be reduced via [narrow]. *)
    val capacity : (_, _) t -> int

    (** [length t] returns the size of [t]'s window. *)
    val length : (_, _) t -> int

    (** [length_lo t] returns the length that [t]'s window would have after calling
        [flip_lo], without actually changing the window. This is the number of bytes
        between the lower limit and the start of the window.

        When you're writing to the window, you can think of this as the number of bytes
        already written. When reading from the window, this can mean the number of bytes
        already consumed.

        This is equivalent to:
        {[
          Iobuf.Expert.(lo t - lo_min t)
        ]}
        . *)
    val length_lo : (_, _) t -> int

    (** [length_hi t] returns the length that [t]'s window would have after calling
        [flip_hi], without actually changing the window. This is the number of bytes
        between the end of the window and the upper limit of the buffer.

        This is equivalent to:
        {[
          Iobuf.Expert.(hi_max t - hi t)
        ]}
        . *)
    val length_hi : (_, _) t -> int

    (** [is_empty t] is [length t = 0]. *)
    val is_empty : (_, _) t -> bool

    (** {2 Changing the limits} *)

    (** [narrow t] sets [t]'s limits to the current window. *)
    val narrow : (_, seek) t -> unit

    (** [narrow_lo t] sets [t]'s lower limit to the beginning of the current window. *)
    val narrow_lo : (_, seek) t -> unit

    (** [narrow_hi t] sets [t]'s upper limit to the end of the current window. *)
    val narrow_hi : (_, seek) t -> unit

    (** {2 Comparison} *)

    (** [memcmp a b] first compares the length of [a] and [b]'s windows and then compares
        the bytes in the windows for equivalence. *)
    val memcmp : (_, _) t -> (_, _) t -> int

    (** {2 Changing the window} *)

    (** One can call [Lo_bound.window t] to get a snapshot of the lower bound of the
        window, and then later restore that snapshot with [Lo_bound.restore]. This is
        useful for speculatively parsing, and then rewinding when there isn't enough data
        to finish.

        Similarly for [Hi_bound.window] and [Lo_bound.restore].

        Using a snapshot with a different iobuf, even a sub iobuf of the snapshotted one,
        has unspecified results. An exception may be raised, or a silent error may occur.
        However, the safety guarantees of the iobuf will not be violated, i.e., the
        attempt will not enlarge the limits of the subject iobuf. *)

    module Lo_bound : Bound
    module Hi_bound : Bound

    (** [advance t amount] advances the lower bound of the window by [amount]. It is an
        error to advance past the upper bound of the window or the lower limit. *)
    val advance : (_, seek) t -> int -> unit

    (** [unsafe_advance] is like [advance] but with no bounds checking, so incorrect usage
        can easily cause segfaults. *)
    val unsafe_advance : (_, seek) t -> int -> unit

    (** [unsafe_resize] is like [resize] but with no bounds checking, so incorrect usage
        can easily cause segfaults. *)
    val unsafe_resize : (_, seek) t -> len:int -> unit

    (** [rewind t] sets the lower bound of the window to the lower limit. *)
    val rewind : (_, seek) t -> unit

    (** [reset t] sets the window to the limits. *)
    val reset : (_, seek) t -> unit

    (** [flip_lo t] sets the window to range from the lower limit to the lower bound of
        the old window. This is typically called after a series of [Fill]s, to reposition
        the window in preparation to [Consume] the newly written data.

        The bounded version narrows the effective limit. This can preserve some data near
        the limit, such as a hypothetical packet header (in the case of [bounded_flip_lo])
        or unfilled suffix of a buffer (in [bounded_flip_hi]). *)
    val flip_lo : (_, seek) t -> unit

    val bounded_flip_lo : (_, seek) t -> Lo_bound.t -> unit

    (** [compact t] copies data from the window to the lower limit of the iobuf and sets
        the window to range from the end of the copied data to the upper limit. This is
        typically called after a series of [Consume]s to save unread data and prepare for
        the next series of [Fill]s and [flip_lo]. *)

    (** [flip_hi t] sets the window to range from the the upper bound of the current
        window to the upper limit. This operation is dual to [flip_lo] and is typically
        called when the data in the current (narrowed) window has been processed and the
        window needs to be positioned over the remaining data in the buffer. For example:

        {[
          (* ... determine initial_data_len ... *)
          Iobuf.resize buf ~len:initial_data_len;
          (* ... and process initial data ... *)
          Iobuf.flip_hi buf
        ]}

        Now the window of [buf] ranges over the remainder of the data. *)
